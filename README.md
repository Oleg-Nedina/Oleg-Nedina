# Hi there, I'm Oleg Nedina ! 👋

### 🎓 HPC Engineering Student @ Politecnico di Milano

I am a passionate developer focused on **High Performance Computing**, **Low-Level Programming**, and **Embedded Systems**. My approach to engineering is grounded in mathematical modeling and complex problem-solving. I love diving deep into memory management and parallelization to squeeze every bit of performance out of the hardware.
